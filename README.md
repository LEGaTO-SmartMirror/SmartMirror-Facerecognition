# SmartMirror-Facerecognition
[MagicMirrorÂ²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) module for face recognition. This module shall be optimized with the [LEGaTO](https://legato-project.eu/) toolkit for energy efficiency.
Uses the camera stream of the [SmartMirror-Camera-Publisher](https://github.com/LEGaTO-SmartMirror/SmartMirror-Camera-Publisher), which creates a appsink under /tmp/camera_image_1m .
It returns a json object with the position, tracking id, id, confidence, and name of each detected Face to the scope "DETECTED_FACES".

# Requirements
- CUDA (9.1)
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn

(only tested with ubuntu 16.04)

# Face Recognition Trial
To try out the face recognition simply start the python script **/facerecognition/start_recognition_webcam.py**

# Structure of the TensorFlow Face Recognition

## Pipeline
Image -> FaceDetection -> CroppedFace -> FaceRecognition -> Descriptor(128D) -> FaceClassifier -> Name

## FaceDetection(mobilenetSSD)
A mobilenet SSD(single shot multibox detector) based face detector with pretrained model provided.
Ref. [https://github.com/yeephycho/tensorflow-face-detection](https://github.com/yeephycho/tensorflow-face-detection)

## FaceRecognition(FaceNet)
TensorFlow implementation of the face recognizer described in the paper "FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering".
Ref. [https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet)

## FaceClassification(kNN, SVM)
Classify the features generated by FaceNet with kNN or SVM.


# Example of the json object:

{"DETECTED_FACES": [{"TrackID": 1.0, "center": [0.12593, 0.7125], "name": "Nils", "w_h": [0.2463, 0.15417], "confidence": "0.86", "ID": 4 }]}
